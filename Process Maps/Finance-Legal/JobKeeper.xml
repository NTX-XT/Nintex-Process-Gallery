          <Text>How do I determine a fall in turnover?</Text>
          <Attachment>To work out your fall in turnover, you can compare either:|~|- GST turnover for March 2020 with GST turnover for March 2019|~|- projected GST turnover for April 2020 with GST turnover for April 2019|~|- projected GST turnover for the quarter starting April 2020 with GST turnover for the quarter starting April 2019.|~|How you choose to project your fall in turnover is not dependent on whether you report a quarterly or monthly BAS, though you can do that if it is easier. The turnover calculation is based on GST turnover. This applies even if an entity is not registered for GST. There are some modifications, including disregarding GST grouping (where two or more associated business entities operate as a single GST group).|~||~|You can satisfy the fall in turnover test in two ways.|~||~|If you work out that you qualify for JobKeeper payments for the first fortnight because your turnover has declined by the relevant amount, you remain eligible and do not need to keep testing turnover in following months. However, you will have ongoing monthly reporting requirements.|~||~|The Commissioner of Taxation also has the discretion to set out alternative tests that can establish your eligibility when turnover periods are not appropriately comparable (for example, if your business has been in operation less than a year). We will provide more information soon about alternative tests.</Attachment>
